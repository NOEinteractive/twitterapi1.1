#Twitter API Integration
##What?
Twitter recently carried on its API housekeeping, and that changed many things.
Some of the requests to the API now require a properly authenticated user to work.
In this php demonstration, we will show you how to properly authenticate your user using oAuth, to be authorised to make requests to the 1.1 API.
There's also a demo page that illustrates the implementation.

##How?
There's a complete blog article about the solution on NOE interactive's website here: http://noe-interactive.com/integration-de-la-nouvelle-api-twitter-1-1
